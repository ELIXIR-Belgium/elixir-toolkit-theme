title: About
---

This project started when we wanted to make a static website that is deployed using GitHub pages that is 

- modern looking
- lightweight
- flexible when it comes to branding
- has a collapsible sidebar to handle a lot of content
- a robust search function 

and this offered trough a Jekyll theme that is actively maintained. Apparently we where asking to much, since none of the themes that we found checked all of these boxes.


We at ELIXIR Belgium had experience using the commonly used [Jekyll Documentation Theme](https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/) and [Just the docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs), and used this experience for the development of our own theme to check all the boxes we needed.
