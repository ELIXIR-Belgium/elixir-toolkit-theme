</p>

The ELIXIR toolkit theme is a Jekyll theme designed to support easy deployment of documentation websites but also more complex ones that require a central tool table and linking towards ELIXIR resources. 

Its key features:
- Easy deployment using GitHub pages
- Advanced content search
- Create your own look with the many theme variables
- Change style using custom classes
- Support for a central tools table
- Page tagging and listing of those tagged pages
- Linking to ELIXIR resources including Bio.tools, FAIRsharing, FAIR Cookbook, TeSS and DSW
- Easy side navigation, top navigation and footer management
- Mobile friendly
- Create website sections with each section having its own sidebar
- Out of the box search engine optimizations including schema.org attributes and many other metadata attributes
- Support for Google Analytics, Matomo and Plausible

## Enabling the theme on your Jekyll project

The quickest way to use the elixir-toolkit-theme is setting it as a [remote theme](https://blog.github.com/2017-11-29-use-any-theme-with-github-pages/) in your `config.yml` file:

```yaml
remote_theme: ELIXIR-Belgium/elixir-toolkit-theme
```

You can lock it onto a specific version like using:

```yaml
remote_theme: ELIXIR-Belgium/elixir-toolkit-theme@1.25.0
```

### Using Ruby Gems (alternative)

Alternatively you can use the Ruby Gem of the theme (needed when using GitLab) by adding this line to your Jekyll site's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "elixir-toolkit-theme"
```
You can lock it onto a specific version like this:

```ruby
gem "elixir-toolkit-theme", "~> 1.25.0"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: elixir-toolkit-theme
```

## Deployment

### Via GitHub Actions

1. Make sure you have a GitHub workflow file setup similar to the one in this repo at [.github/workflows/jekyll.yml](https://github.com/ELIXIR-Belgium/elixir-toolkit-theme/blob/main/.github/workflows/jekyll.yml).

2. Go to Settings > Pages and enable GitHub Actions as a source
3. Go to Environments > github-pages and remove the rule under Deployment branches if you want to deploy other branches than master or main via Workflow Dispatch (manually triggered action)

### Via GitHub Pages

This is the quickest way to deploy the elixir-toolkit-theme, but gives less flexibility and does not allow you to make use of the new way of tagging tools. Visit the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/) to find out more about how to setup GitHub pages. 

NOTE: This way of deploying does not support the tool-tag in the text of the markdown file to tag tools and resources.

### Via GitLab Pages

Add an extra `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the root of the repo with:

```yml
image: ruby:2.7

variables:
  JEKYLL_ENV: production

before_script:
  - bundle install

pages:
  stage: deploy
  script:
  - bundle exec jekyll build -d public
  artifacts:
    paths:
    - public
  only:
  - master

```


### Locally using Jekyll

1. If not already present on your machine, install **ruby**. 

1. Install Jekyll
If you have never installed or run a Jekyll site locally on your computer, follow these instructions to install Jekyll: [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

    ```
    gem install jekyll bundler
    ```

1. Install dependencies

    ```
    bundle install
    ```

1. deploy website

    ```
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```

Additional information can be found at the following link: [https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll)


### Locally using Docker

If not already installed on your machine, install Docker. From the root of the `elixir-toolkit-theme` directory, run:

```sh
docker run -it --rm -p [::1]:4000:4000 -v $PWD:/srv/jekyll jekyll/jekyll:latest /bin/bash -c "chmod a+w /srv/jekyll/Gemfile.lock && chmod 777 /srv/jekyll && bundle install && bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0"
```

This will start the docker container and serve the website locally. Make sure the `.\_site` is not yet created to avoid permission errors.
