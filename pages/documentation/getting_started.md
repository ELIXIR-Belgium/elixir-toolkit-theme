## Fork our basic example

To help you started we made a [very basic repository](https://github.com/ELIXIR-Belgium/elixir-toolkit-theme-example) that can be used as template for your upcoming Jekyll website using our theme. 


## Enable GitHub pages

Deploy your website using GitHub pages by enabling it on your repository. Visit the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/) to find out more about how to setup GitHub pages.
