title: Branding
---


The theme is made so one can easily customize the styling and add personal branding to the website.

## Branding in top navigation

Change the icon in the topnav by adding a `main_logo.svg` file in the `assets/img/` directory.
If you want to use another file format or use a different filename, please specify this in the theme variable section of the `_config.yml` file. For more info on this config file please visit our [Configuring the theme](custom_branding) page.

```yml
theme_variables: 
 topnav:
   brand_logo: assets/img/main_logo.svg
```
